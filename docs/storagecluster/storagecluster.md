# G8OS Storage Cluster

A G8OS resource pool typically includes one or more storage clusters.

Setting up a storage cluster is achieved through the resource pool API exposed by the resource pool server, as documented in [Setup a Storage Cluster](setup.md)

Once you have a storage cluster setup it can be used for multiple purposes, most importantly for creating vdisks as discussed in [Block Storage](/docs/blockstorage/blockstorage.md).
