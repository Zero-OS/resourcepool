# Getting Started with G8OS Resource Pool

You will most probably want to start with setting up a G8OS resource pool, as documented in [Resource Pool Development Setup](/docs/setup/dev.md).

This will allow you then to:
- Interact with the resource pool API as discussed in [Resource Pool API](/docs/api.md)
- Setup a storage cluster using the resource pool API as documented in [Storage Cluster](/docs/storagecluster/storagecluster.md)
- Test block storage, documented in [Block Storage](/docs/blockstorage/blockstorage.md)
