# Getting Started with Zero-OS Orchestrator

You will most probably want to start with setting up a Zero-OS cluster, as documented in [Zero-OS Orchestrator Development Setup](/docs/setup/README.md).

This will allow you then to:
- Interact with the RESTful API exposed by the Zero-OS Orchestrator, as discussed in [Zero-OS Orchestrator RESTful API](/docs/api/README.md)
- Setup a storage cluster using the Zero-OS Orchestrator RESTful API as documented in [Storage Cluster](/docs/storagecluster/README.md)
- Test block storage, documented in [Block Storage](/docs/blockstorage/README.md)
